# How to secure an API

## What is an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. In simple words, it refers to an interface that allows an application to access data from other application.

Is a set of rules or protocols that allows computer applications to communicate with each other to exchange data, features and functionality.

## Why it is important to secure them?

This method of communication is the most used around the world, is the entry point for numerous systems and databases.
These include web and mobile applications, systems interconnection, online payments, third-party services and IoT systems.

Because of this, it is very important to have this considerations when making an API:

export let icon = false;
export const description1 = [
  "If an API handles personal, financial, or medical information, it must prevent leaks or unauthorized access.",
  "Use of encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data in transit.",
];

export const description2 = [
  "Poorly protected APIs can be vulnerable to attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), brute force attacks and API scraping.",
  "Validation and sanitization of input data to prevent attacks.",
];

export const description3 = [
  "It is crucial that only authorized users can interact with certain resources, preventing malicious actors from exploiting the API.",
  "You can use Secure authentication and authorization (OAuth 2.0, JWT, API Keys).",
];

export const description4 = [
  "An attack like DDoS can overload an API and cause the service to stop working",
  "Implementation of rate limiting to avoid abuse.",
];

# How to

I have created a basic API with node.js and express to show how we can add some security measures to avoid malintentioned people to have a bad use of it.
